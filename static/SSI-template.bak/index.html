    <p>The Health On the Net Foundation (HON) promotes and guides the deployment of useful and reliable online
        health information, and its appropriate and efficient use. Created in 1995, HON is a non-profit,
        non-governmental organization, accredited to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations.
        For 15 years, HON has focused on the essential question of the provision of health information to citizens,
        information that respects ethical standards. To cope with the unprecedented volume of healthcare
        information available on the Net, the HONcode of conduct offers a multi-stakeholder consensus on
        standards to protect citizens from misleading health information.
    <p>HON is funded by the State of Geneva, several European projects, the French National Health Authority
        (HAS) and the Provisu foundation. HON is also supported by the Geneva Hospital since its inception.
